Robotic Software Engineering Localization

Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization Project

To run the project, use the following command in the terminal:

$ cd catkin_ws

$ source devel/setup.bash

$ roslaunch my_robot world.launch

In a second terminal, run the following:

$ roslaunch my_robot amcl.launch

To complete this project, I referenced the two following repositories for its directory structure and AMCL parameter tuning:
1.) https://github.com/rfzeg/udacity_bot
2.) https://github.com/DanielsKraus/Robotics-Software-Engineer
3.) https://github.com/huuanhhuynguyen/RoboND-Where-Am-I/blob/master/my_robot/launch/amcl.launch
